#Scenario
#Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.

#Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall – it's flat. The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

#The figure illustrates the rule used by the builders:

#your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

#Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers – if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.

#Test your code using the data we've provided.

#Key: DO NOT TRY TO SOLVE THE EQUATION, SIMPLY EVALUATE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND PYTHON WILL WORK OUT THE EQUATION.

#input numberof blocks
number_of_blocks= int(input("Number of blocks? ") )

#blocks remaining variable
blocks_remaining = number_of_blocks

#blocks per line variable/ initialised as 1 (for first row)
blocks_used_per_line =1

height = 0

while blocks_remaining > 0:
    #height counter
    height = height + 1

    #this increases based on algorithm
    blocks_used_per_line =blocks_used_per_line + 1

    #this removes the total blocks used on the line
    blocks_remaining -= blocks_used_per_line

print (height)
