#Scenario
#The continue statement is used to skip the current block and move ahead to the next iteration, without executing the statements inside the loop.

#It can be used with both the while and for loops.

#Your task here is very special: you must design a vowel eater! Write a program that uses:

#a for loop;
#the concept of conditional execution (if-elif-else)
#the continue statement.
#Your program must:

#ask the user to enter a word;
#use user_word = user_word.upper() to convert the word entered by the user to upper case; we'll talk about string methods and the upper() method very soon â€“ don't worry;
#use conditional execution and the continue statement to "eat" the following vowels A, E, I, O, U from the inputted word;
#print the uneaten letters to the screen, each one of them on a separate line.
#Test your program with the data we've provided for you.


###############-------------------#####################

word = (input("Enter word? "))
print(word.upper()) # Prints word in uppercase. This has created a new string


for i in word.upper(): #Looks for i in the upper case variable
    
    if (i == "A"): #if i matches uppercase A, omit from string
        continue
    elif (i == "E"): #if i matches uppercase E, omit from string....
        continue
    elif (i == "I"): 
        continue
    elif (i == "O"): 
        continue
    elif (i == "U"): 
        continue
    print ("the constentants", i.upper()) #Print everything with without the vowles
