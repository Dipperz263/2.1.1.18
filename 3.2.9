#The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.

#Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

#Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

word= input("enter Word? ") #Enters a word


while True: #repeats indefinatly until break is enetred
 
    if word == "chump": #if the entered word and exit word match?
        print ("You've successfully left the loop") #print this
        break #break from loop
 
    else:
        word= input("enter Word? ") #Else go back to the start
